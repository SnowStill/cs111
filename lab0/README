lab0.c:
The C file that is used to compile the excutable file.
It copies its standard input to its standard output, but it will read from file descriptor 0 and write to file descriptor 1 with the read() and write() functions if we use the options 
--input and --output. Option --segfault will force a segmentation fault. --catch will register a handler to catch the segmentation fault.

Makefile:
deafult: builds an executable file.

check:
The smoke chaeck has the following indivisual checks:

GeneralIOtest: This test simply runs with defined --input and --output options to see if it exits with the code 0.
SegCatchtest: This test simply runs with defined --segfault and --catch options to see if it exits with the code 4 by catching the segment fault with defined handler.

Standardtest: Test the standard input and output. Using the echo command and pipeline to the excute command ./lab0 to see if it exits normally with code 0.

Argtest: Test with the wrong argument, and check if exits with code 1: unrecognized argument

inputtest: Test with a file that does not exist and check if the program exits with code 2.

Permissiontest: Test with a file that we do not have the permission to write, read, and excute for the output file. The program should exit with code 3.
