Question 2.1.1 - causing conflicts
	 The race condiotion is less likely to happen with less iteration since it takes 
	 a shoreter time to finsih the task. If it is short enogh, the cpu can finish 
	 quickly before the next process coming up.  If one task is long enough, 
	 it may causes some overlaps with other threads. Thus smaller number of iterations so seldom fail.

Question 2.1.2
	 Yiled runs slower since it costs significant time to interrpt the ongoing threads and switch to a new thread by calling the system call. 
	 So most of them was wasted from the swiching.
	 It is not possible to get valid per-operation timings since multiple threads and yields are going on. The time becopmes unpredicable.
QUESTION 2.1.3 - measurement errors
	 The resource is limited. As a result of increasing number of iterations, much more time is used to do the calculation instead of creating new processes.
	 The time was used to create new threads are now used to run more iterations, so the average cost per operation gets lower as we divide the number of process.
	 To get the correct cost, we need to run a very high number of iterators, which makes the resource that threads takes becomes as less as possible 

QUESTION 2.1.4 - costs of serialization:
	 Lower number of threads means lower chance the conflicts are likely to happen. The locks are not used much, so there woldn't be many difference.
	 Higher number of threas means higher chance the conflicts are likely to happen. There can be numerous threads sharing the one source, so it means more ofeten the threads
	 need to wait for the unlock.

QUESTION 2.2.1 - scalability of Mutex
	 The curve in List-4 is more like a line with a constant slope. More Threads have higher CPO 
	 On the other hand, the curve in Add 5 is like a Exponential function. As the number of threads increase, the 
	 slower the cost per operations grows. Also CAS is going to catch up the mutex CPO at arount 16 threads.
	 	 
	
QUESTION 2.2.2 - scalability of spin locks
