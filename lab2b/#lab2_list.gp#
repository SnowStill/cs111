# purpose:
#	 generate data reduction graphs for the multi-threaded list project
#
# input: lab2_list.csv
#	1. test name
#	2. # threads
#	3. # iterations per thread
#	4. # lists
#	5. # operations performed (threads x iterations x (ins + lookup + delete))
#	6. run time (ns)
#	7. run time per operation (ns)
#       8.lock time per operation
# output:
#	lab2_1.png ... Total number of operations per second for each synchronization
#	lab2_2.png ... threads and iterations that run (un-protected) w/o failure
#	lab2_3.png ... threads and iterations that run (protected) w/o failure
#	lab2_4.png ... cost per operation vs number of threads
#
# Note:
#	Managing data is simplified by keeping all of the results in a single
#	file.  But this means that the individual graphing commands have to
#	grep to select only the data they want.
#
#	Early in your implementation, you will not have data for all of the
#	tests, and the later sections may generate errors for missing data.
